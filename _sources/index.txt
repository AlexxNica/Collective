github/collective - experimental (repeat: experimental)
=======================================================

Recently we started an organization on github called "collective". You could
consider the `github/collective`_ as an evaluation area for possible enhancement of
current `svn/collective`_.


.. important::

    Keep in mind this is experimental, experimental and once again
    experimental.

I'm not sure how best to emphasize this, but this is not officially
supported or started by the Plone Foundation, but they probably appreciate any
effort to make development processes easier. We are just bunch of git
enthusiasts who think service like github could bring some order in the mess
we have in `svn/collective`_. And instead of working in our own github accounts,
we bring the spirit of Plone collective to github.


"Rules" on github/collective
----------------------------

Nothing really to actually add from what you've been used to from
`svn/collective`_. By default you are added to github/collective 'All' group.
You are then able to create new project inside collective organisation. Once you
create them you set who all has rights to participate in this project. By default
it will add everybody from 'All' group to be able to read and write to project.


How to get access
-----------------

For now write to `collective@garbas.si`_ and don't forget to tell us your
**Github username**.
