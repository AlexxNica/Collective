github/collective - experimental (repeat: experimental) for possible enhancement of svn/collective
==================================================================================================

Recently we started organization on github called "collective". You could
consider `github/collective`_ as evaluation area for possible enhancement of
current `svn/collective`_.

**Keep in mind this is experimental, experimental and once again
experimental.**

I'm not sure how best to emphasis this, but this is nothing officially
supported or started from Plone Fundation, but they probably appreciate any
effort to make development processes easier. We are just bunch of git
enthusiasts who think service like github could bring some order in the mess
we have in svn-collective. And instead of working in our own github accounts,
we bring the spirit of Plone collective to github.
