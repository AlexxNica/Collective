Who this evaluation is for?
===========================

`github/collective`_ is meant for:

    * developers who are already familiar with git or the not feeling afraid
    * their companies are already using git or even github for their work
    * and for those who are aware that in case of not using github for
      collective this organisation might be turned off and they will have
      to move their code to their own user accounts (2 clicks) or import it
      into svn/collective (3 commands)

Why we didn't ask wider Plone Community and raise debate on mailing list first?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Main reason is that I tried to talk with many people about this and what I got
back was speculations "Git is too hard to learn." and some more speculations
"Github can not fit into the collective way of working together.". And I don't
blame them ... really I don't. So I'm on a missing to collect some facts. Facts
about whether we could use service like github in spirit of collective and
improve our way of working together. This raises a number of different
questions, from administration point of view, to documentation point of view ...
since this is impossible to predict and to explore in advance we need to take
this steps slowly and have some "experimental group" doing this for us.

    Join us now. Send PM to garbas (on github) or just scream github/collective
    on #plone channel

But I don't like git, I think X (place your favorite VCS here) is better and easier to learn?

OK, I have heard that a lot of times. Maybe you didn't notice but in text above I was not
mentioning git at all. Yes I was always talking about github. But why is that
different? I'm not on a mission how to convert all of you to use git, I want to
explore how "social coding" might benefit us. If you don't want to use git you can
also use Hg with github or you can even use svn to checkout and commit to github
project (this is only limited to master/trunk but this might change soon). But
why github and not bitbucket for example? I might be a little bit biased here
because I'm a git user myself, but some facts are not to be missed. The only
real "social coding" is actually happening on github, at least thats why numbers
(of users) say. Well if not real at least more of "social coding" is happening
at github and we will see our results faster.

And after evaluation period?
----------------------------

We'll try to investigate github for a bit, see how it fits our "collective-ness".
If I say we some time frame after which we will bring this into discussion to
plone developers / users list, I would be shooting blank. It might be one or two
months from now, it might be more ... I certain that we will all know when time
will come. Right now I wont focus on any date, but I will try to make
github/collective a friendly place to share code.
