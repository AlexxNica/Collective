How to use Transifex_
=====================

What is Transifex_
------------------

Transifex is an open service allowing people to collaboratively translate
software, documentation and other types of projects. Designed as a hub for
translations of open source projects, Transifex supports translations straight
from the project's source.

Why should I use Transifex_
---------------------------

I see two main reasons:

* Let non technical people contribute to translation of your add-on.
* `Monitor status of translations`_

How to use Transifex_ as translator
-----------------------------------

* register on transifex.net
* join or create a team for your language for the Plone project
* once it is validated you can participate to project

Current status: We use transifex to monitor translations, but we work on 
integration with svn collective. but github is already supported. So if the
project is hosted on github/collective you can start to translate the project.
