How to follow commits
=====================

With svn collective you are used to follow commits (suscribed to the collective-checkins@lists.sourceforge.net 
mailing list).

With github it can be achieved by using a private rss feed.

First you have to be part of the organization. You have to go to your dashboard screen and be sure your current context
is on collective organization. Now you just have to use the 'News Feed' button, above the 'Switch Context' menu.
